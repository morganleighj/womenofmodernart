							<h2>Natalia Goncharova</h2>
							<blockquote><p>Natalia Goncharova (1881-1962) was a Russian painter, stage designer, printmaker and illustrator. She was a leading artist of the <a href="#">Russian avant-garde<img src="images/gon/1.jpg" /></a> in the early 20th century but became a celebrity in the West through her work for serge Diaghilev and the Ballets russes. During the 1920s she played a significant role within the Ecole de Paris. <a href="#">Rayonism<img src="images/gon/3.jpg" /></a>, an ermerging art form, was taken, transformed, and improved to fit the uniquely Russian culture. Several influences were combined to make Rayonism the strikingly abstract style that it is. As Goncharova turned to the East, she began to find inspiration specifically in folk art forms such as <a href="#">primitive art<img src="images/gon/4.jpg" /></a>.<br><br>
On June 18, 2007, Goncharova's 1909 painting <a href="#">Picking Apples<img src="images/gon/2.jpg" /></a> was auctioned at Christie's for $9.8 million, setting a record for any female artist.</p></blockquote>

							<h2>Georgia O'Keeffe</h2>
							<blockquote><p>&#8220;Finally, a woman on paper!&#8221; exclaimed Alfred Stieglitz in 1916, after he looked at Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s charcoal drawings.<br><br>
Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986) is an American artist who attended the Art Institute of Chicago and a year later went to study at the Art Students League of New York. O&#8217;Keeffe first came to the attention of the New York art community in 1916. She made large-format paintings of <a href="#">enlarged blossoms<img src="images/ok/3.jpg" /></a>, presenting them close up as if seen through a magnifying lens, and New York buildings, most of which date from the same decade. Beginning in 1929, when she began working part of the year in Northern New Mexico&#8212;which she made her permanent home in 1949&#8212;O&#8217;Keeffe depicted sun-bleached <a href="#">animal bones<img src="images/ok/4.jpg" /></a> and the rugged mountains that dominate that terrain. O&#8217;Keeffe has been recognized as the Mother of American Modernism.<br><br>
In 1985 she received the Medal of the Arts from President Ronald Reagan.</p></blockquote>

							<h2>Sonia Delaunay</h2>
							<blockquote><p>Sonia Delaunay (1885-1979) was a Jewish-French artist who, with her husband <a href="#">Robert Delaunay<img src="images/del/2.jpg" /></a> and others, cofounded the <a href="#">Orphism art movement<img src="images/del/3.jpg" /></a>, noted for its use of strong colours and <a href="#">geometric shapes<img src="images/del/4.jpg" /></a>. Her work extends to painting, textile design and stage set design. She was the first living female artist to have a retrospective exhibition at the Louvre in 1964, and in 1975 was named an officer of the French Legion of Honor.<br><br>
Her work in modern design included the concepts of geometric abstraction, the integration of furniture, fabrics, wall coverings, and <a href="#">clothing<img src="images/del/1.jpg" /></a>.</p></blockquote>

							<h2>Varvara Stepanova</h2>
							<blockquote><p>Varvara Stepanova (1894-1958) was a painter, photographer and designer. She was influential as member of the group of artists that worked in the <a href="#">Russian avant-garde movement<img src="images/step/1.jpg" /></a> and, later in her career, she would refer to herself as a constructivist. Her work shows a direct influence of the Cubists and the Futurist art movements and she spent her career dedicated to trying to use her work to create <a href="#">revolutionary change<img src="images/step/6.jpg" /></a> within society.<br><br>
As a designer she created everything from posters and books to sets and costumes for local theaters. She became so involved with the world of theater design that she even <a href="#">designed textiles<img src="images/step/3.jpg" /></a> for use in the manufacturing of the <a href="#">costumes<img src="images/step/7.jpg" /></a> for the productions she helped design. Her work, along with the work of the rest of the Russian avant-garde and Constructivist artists, helped pave the way for all modern day graphic designers as they created art with a purpose in hopes of <a href="#">bettering the society<img src="images/step/5.jpg" /></a> in which they lived.</p></blockquote>

							<h2>Kay Sage</h2>
							<blockquote><p>The American Surrealist painter Kay Sage (1898-1963) made dreamlike, architectural structures bathed in a sulfuric light the hallmark of her painted imagery. In so doing, she set her work apart from all other artists championed by Surrealism&#8217;s founder, the French poet Andre Breton. In rejecting the <a href="#">biomorphic forms<img src="images/kay/3.jpg" /></a> so prevalent in abstract Surrealist imagery, and in particular those characterized by the work of her husband, <a href="#">Yves Tanguy<img src="images/kay/4.jpg" /></a>, Sage did much more than carve out a niche in the pantheon of Surrealist imagery: she also created a historical position for her work. Sage was a member of the Golden Age, and later the Post-War periods of <a href="#">surrealism<img src="images/kay/1.jpg" /></a>, she is mostly recognized for her artistic works, which typically contain themes of an <a href="#">architectural nature<img src="images/kay/2.jpg" /></a>.</p></blockquote>

							<h2>Frida Kahlo</h2>
							<blockquote><p>Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) was a Mexican painter, born in Coyoac&#225;n.  Perhaps best known for her <a href="#">self-portraits<img src="images/fk/1.jpg" /></a>, Kahlo's work is remembered for its "pain and passion", and its intense, vibrant colors. Her work has been celebrated in Mexico as emblematic of national and indigenous tradition, and by feminists for its uncompromising depiction of the <a href="#">female experience<img src="images/fk/2.jpg" /></a> and form.<br><br>
Mexican culture and Amerindian cultural tradition figure prominently in her work, which has sometimes been characterized as Na&#239;ve art or folk art.  Her work has also been described as "surrealist", and in 1938 one surrealist described Kahlo herself as a "ribbon around a bomb".<br><br>
During her lifetime, Frida created some 200 paintings, drawings and sketches related to her experiences in life, physical and emotional pain and her turbulent relationship with <a href="#">Diego Rivera<img src="images/fk/4.jpg" /></a>. She produced 143 paintings, 55 of which are self-portraits. When asked why she painted so many <a href="#">self-portraits<img src="images/fk/3.jpg" /></a>, Frida replied: &#8220;Because I am so often alone....because I am the subject I know best.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

							<h2>Helen Frankenthaler</h2>
							<blockquote><p>Helen Frankenthaler (1928-2011) was an American abstract <a href="#">expressionist painter<img src="images/hf/1.jpg" /></a>. She was a major contributor to the history of postwar American painting. Having exhibited her work for over six decades (early 1950s until 2011), she spanned several generations of abstract painters while continuing to produce vital and ever-changing <a href="#">new work<img src="images/hf/2.jpg" /></a>. Frankenthaler began exhibiting her large-scale abstract expressionist paintings in contemporary <a href="#">museums and galleries<img src="images/hf/5.jpg" /></a> in the early 1950s. She was included in the 1964 <i>Post-Painterly Abstraction</i> exhibition curated by Clement Greenberg that introduced a newer generation of abstract painting that came to be known as <a href="#">Color Field<img src="images/hf/4.jpg" /></a>.<br><br>
Frankenthaler's work has been the subject of several retrospective exhibitions, including a 1989 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and been exhibited worldwide since the 1950s.</p></blockquote>

							<h2>Faith Ringgold</h2>
							<blockquote><p>Faith Ringgold (born in 1930) is an African-American artist, best known for her painted story quilts. During the 1960s, Ringgold painted flat, figural compositions that focused on the racial conflicts; depicting everything from riots to <a href="#">cocktail parties<img src="images/fr/1.png" /></a>, which resulted in her &#8220;American People&#8221; series, showing the female view of the Civil Rights Movement. The 1970s was her move into the sculptural figures that were used for fictional slave stories as well as contemporary ones. Ringgold began quilted artwork in 1980; her first quilt being &#8220;Echoes of Harlem.&#8221; She quilted her stories in order to be heard, since at the time no one would publish her autobiography. <a href="#">&#8220;Who's Afraid of Aunt Jemima?&#8221;<img src="images/fr/2.jpg" /></a> (1983) is a quilt showing the story of Aunt Jemima as a matriarch restaurateur. Ringgold modeled her <a href="#">story quilts<img src="images/fr/3.jpg" /></a> on the Buddhist Thangkas, lovely pictures painted on fabric and quilted or brocaded, which could then be easily rolled up and transported.</p></blockquote>
